Generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. Curating a top-level summary of the study results.

In a animal study assessing the effectiveness of different tumor treatments, we analyzed data from 248 mice. After cleaning the data comparing the performance of the drug Capomulin versus various regimens like Ramican, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, findings indicated that Capomulin showed strong performance in managing final tumor volume.  

There is a strong positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the final tumor volume. With heavier mice tending to have larger tumors, the potential impact of body weight on tumor growth and treatment efficacy is apparent. Understanding this relationship could help inform future studies and treatment protocols.
